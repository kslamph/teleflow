## Running the Example

1. Set your Telegram bot token:

   export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
   ```

   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

## Testing and Safety

This example includes proper concurrent programming practices:

- **Race Condition Detection**: Test with the race detector enabled:
  ```bash
  go run -race .
  ```

- **Thread-Safe Operations**: The business service uses read-write mutexes properly to avoid deadlocks and race conditions

- **Double-Checked Locking**: The account initialization uses the standard double-checked locking pattern to prevent duplicate initialization in concurrent scenarios
